I like going out on Christmas Eve
If Santa needs a helper, why should it be me?
And I like dancing the night away
And waking up to jingle bells on Christmas Day

And Christmas morning
When the church bells ring
My heart starts beating fast
Oh I'll never stop being a big kid
Deep in my heart

(CHORUS)
I wanna kiss you so, like no one's done before
Under the mistletoe, we'll fall in love for sure
It's only a kiss you know, so don't you ask for more
Under the mistletoe, we'll fall in love for sure

I make angels in the snow
I like that funny feeling when my bum gets cold
And I like getting in a snowball fight
Then racing my toboggan through the starry night

And Christmas morning
When the church bells ring
My heart starts beating fast
Oh I'll never stop being a big kid
Deep in my heart

(CHORUS)
I wanna kiss you so, like no one's done before
Under the mistletoe, we'll fall in love for sure
It's only a kiss you know, so don't you ask for more
Under the mistletoe, we'll fall in love for sure

Christmas ain't fun
If your heart don't feel young
I guess I'll always believe
There's a big kid in me

And Christmas morning
When the church bells ring
My heart starts beating fast
Oh I'll never stop being a big kid
Deep in my heart

(CHORUS)
I wanna kiss you so, like no one's done before
Under the mistletoe, we'll fall in love for sure
It's only a kiss you know, so don't you ask for more
Under the mistletoe, we'll fall in love for sure

Bish bash bong woo!
We're just another Christmas
Crazy family, baby
Bish bash bong woo!
We'll be loving Christmas Day
Oh, when we're 80

Bish bash bong woo!
We're just another Christmas
Crazy family, baby
Bish bash bong woo!
We'll be loving Christmas Day
Oh, when we're 80

Bish bash bong woo!
We're just another Christmas
Crazy family, baby
Bish bash bong woo!
We'll be loving Christmas Day
Oh, when we're 80
