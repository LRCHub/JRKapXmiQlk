You were never here
With you tender look at me
Big smile, and you smooth skin
I, i, i wonder why

I would be listening to every word
Whispers of your sweet mouth
I would stay by your side
But i must say goodbye

Go away, go away
If you want to hear the truth
I just wanna kiss you

I would be listening to every word
Whispers of your sweet mouth
I would stay by your side
But i must say goodbye

Go away, go away
If you want to hear the truth
I just wanna kiss you
I just wanna kiss you
